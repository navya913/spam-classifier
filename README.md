# Spam Classifier

## Overview
This project is a **Spam Classifier** that uses machine learning techniques to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages. The classifier is trained on a dataset of text messages and can predict whether a given message is spam or not.

## Features
- Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, etc.)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer
- Machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- GUI or CLI for easy message classification

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.7). You can install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## Usage
### Training the Model
To train the spam classifier, run:
```bash
python train.py
```

### Testing the Model
To test the model on sample data, use:
```bash
python test.py --input message.txt
```

### Classifying a New Message
To classify a single message:
```bash
python classify.py --message "Congratulations! You've won a free iPhone. Click here to claim."
```

## Dataset
The classifier is trained on the **SMS Spam Collection** dataset, which contains labeled spam and ham (legitimate) messages.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using standard classification metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness
- **Precision**: Fraction of relevant instances among retrieved instances
- **Recall**: Measures the ability to detect spam
- **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

## Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning-based text classification
- Deploy as a web application using Flask or FastAPI
- Train on a larger dataset for improved performance
